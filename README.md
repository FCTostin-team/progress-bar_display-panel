A comprehensive, interactive web checklist designed to guide players through a complete Factorio playthrough. From the initial burner phase to the final rocket launch, this tool helps organize tasks, track progress across different game stages, and provides helpful tips for both new and experienced engineers.

## Features

* **Stage-Based Progression**: Tasks are organized into logical phases: Early Game (Burner), Mid Game (Oil/Trains), Late Game (Robots/Blue Science), and End Game (Rocket).
* **Progress Tracking**: Automatically calculates and displays completion percentages for each stage and the overall game.
* **Persistent Save**: Uses LocalStorage to save your checked items, allowing you to close the browser and resume your playthrough later.
* **Multilingual Support**: Fully localized interface and content in English, Russian, and Ukrainian.
* **Contextual Help**: Includes tooltips with detailed advice and direct links to the official Factorio Wiki for complex items.
